# Interactive Fractal Generator

A sophisticated Java application that generates recursive fractal patterns with real-time user interaction and customizable visual themes.

## Features
- **Recursive fractal generation** using Sierpinski triangle-like algorithms
- **Interactive GUI controls** for recursion depth and opacity
- **Dynamic color themes** loaded from configuration files
- **Real-time rendering** with smooth user interaction
- **Mathematical precision** using circumcenter and geometric calculations

## Technical Highlights
- Observer design pattern implementation
- Complex recursive algorithms with geometric mathematics
- Custom graphics rendering with Java2D
- Dual-window application architecture
- File-based theme configuration system

## Mathematical Concepts
